- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nirmal Budhathoki, a Data Scientist who yearns for solving problems that actually impact product strategy and business outcomes. As a self-described realist, he believes that with pragmatism and high-quality data, Data Science can be a very powerful tool.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new tools and technologies when it comes to Data Science and Machine Learning. Data Science is a moving target and continuous learning is the only option to get closer to it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Natural Language Processing and its applications in Security. 
- ðŸ“« I love helping the aspiring and early career data scientists with mentoring and sharing my own experience to answer their questions. I have conducted about 200+ free mentoring sessions.
